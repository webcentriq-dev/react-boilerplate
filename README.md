# Denali Client Project

## This project is developed with `TypeScript`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App - TypeScript version](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript-React-Starter).

## Running the project

Running the project is as simple as running

```sh
npm run start
```

This runs the `start` script specified in our `package.json`, and will spawn off a server which reloads the page as we save our files.
Typically the server runs at `http://localhost:3000`, but should be automatically opened for you.

This tightens the iteration loop by allowing us to quickly preview changes.

## Testing the project

Testing is also just a command away:

```sh
npm run test
```

This command runs Jest, an incredibly useful testing utility, against all files whose extensions end in `.test.ts` or `.spec.ts`.
Like with the `npm run start` command, Jest will automatically run as soon as it detects changes.
If you'd like, you can run `npm run start` and `npm run test` side by side so that you can preview changes and test them simultaneously.

## Creating a production build

When running the project with `npm run start`, we didn't end up with an optimized build.
Typically, we want the code we ship to users to be as fast and small as possible.
Certain optimizations like minification can accomplish this, but often take more time.
We call builds like this "production" builds (as opposed to development builds).

To run a production build, just run

```sh
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized JS and CSS build in `./build/static/js` and `./build/static/css` respectively.

You won't need to run a production build most of the time,
but it is useful if you need to measure things like the final size of your app.
